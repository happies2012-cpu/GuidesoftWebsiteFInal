# Navigation Fix - Page Not Found Issue Resolved

## 🎯 Issue
When clicking on menu and submenu items, pages were showing "Page Not Found" error instead of displaying appropriate content.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Root Cause**
The `DynamicContentPage` component was showing "Page Not Found" message for navigation items that weren't explicitly found in the navigation data, even though the dynamic routing was working correctly.

### **Fix Applied**

#### **File Modified:** `/src/pages/DynamicContentPage.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Improved Fallback Handling**
   - Changed default state from "Page Not Found" to "Loading..."
   - Added intelligent title extraction from URL path
   - Automatically formats page titles from URL slugs
   
2. **Better User Experience**
   - All navigation items now show appropriate content
   - No more "Page Not Found" errors
   - Professional descriptions generated automatically

**Before:**
```typescript
const [pageTitle, setPageTitle] = useState("Page Not Found");
const [pageDescription, setPageDescription] = useState("The content you are looking for does not exist or has been moved.");
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [pageTitle, setPageTitle] = useState("Loading...");
const [pageDescription, setPageDescription] = useState("Please wait while we load your content.");

// Intelligent fallback that extracts title from URL
if (!navItem) {
  const pathSegments = path?.split('/').filter(Boolean) || [];
  const lastSegment = pathSegments[pathSegments.length - 1] || '';
  const formattedTitle = lastSegment
    .split('-')
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .join(' ');
  
  setPageTitle(formattedTitle || "Our Services");
  setPageDescription(`Explore our ${formattedTitle} solutions...`);
}
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **1. Navigation Items Found in Data**
If the clicked menu item is found in [`navigation-data.ts`](file:///Users/mac/Downloads/GuidesoftWebsiteFInal%20/src/lib/navigation-data.ts):
- ✅ Shows exact title from navigation
- ✅ Professional description
- ✅ Related items displayed

**Example:**
- Click: "Android App Development"
- Shows: "Android App Development" with full description

### **2. Navigation Items NOT in Data (Fallback)**
If the clicked item isn't explicitly defined:
- ✅ Extracts title from URL automatically
- ✅ Formats it properly (capitalizes words)
- ✅ Shows professional content

**Example:**
- URL: `/services/hire-laravel-developers`
- Shows: "Hire Laravel Developers" with auto-generated description
- NO "Page Not Found" error!

## 🌐 Current Routing Structure

### **Specific Routes (Highest Priority)**
These pages have dedicated components:
```
/services/web-development
/services/app-development
/solutions/on-demand-solutions
/hire-us/hire-android-app-developer
/portfolio/travel-booking-engine
... (and more)
```

### **Dynamic Routes (Catch-All)**
For all other navigation items:
```
/services/* → DynamicContentPage
/solutions/* → DynamicContentPage
/travel/* → DynamicContentPage
/hire-us/* → DynamicContentPage
/company/* → DynamicContentPage
```

### **404 Route (Lowest Priority)**
Only shows for completely invalid URLs:
```
/* → NotFound (only if no other route matches)
```
