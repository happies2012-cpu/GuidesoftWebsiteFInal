npm run build
```
**Expected Output:** Build completes in ~20-25 seconds without errors

### Step 2: Test Production Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
# or
npx serve -s dist
```
**Verify:** Test all functionality in production mode

### Step 3: Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### Option A: Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
