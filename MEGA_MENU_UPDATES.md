## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Data Structure
All navigation is powered by `src/lib/navigation-data.ts` which uses:
- **Recursive NavItem Interface**: Supports unlimited nesting levels
- **Automatic Slug Generation**: Converts titles to URL-friendly paths
- **Centralized Management**: Single source of truth for all navigation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface MenuItem {
  title: string;
  url?: string;
  description?: string;
  icon?: JSX.Element;
  items?: MenuItem[];  // Supports nesting
}
```

### Rendering Functions
- `renderMenuItem()`: Desktop mega menu with 3-level display
- `renderMobileMenuItem()`: Mobile accordion with nested expansion
- Automatic icon assignment based on service category
- Dynamic description generation for better SEO
